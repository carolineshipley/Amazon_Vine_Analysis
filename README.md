## Results

The objective of this analyzis is to answer the following questions:
1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

And these are the result of the analyzis:

1. There are 94 vine reviews and 40,471 non-vine reviews.
2. There were 48 5-star vine reviews and 15663 5-star non-vine reviews.

## Summary

Taking into consideration that the sample of non-vine reviews are much greater than vine review,and that the the paid reviews correspond to 51% of 5-starts and un-paid correspond to 38% of the 5-stars. With that we can conclude that there is a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. 
An additional analysis to have a better understanding of reviews patterns is to analyze REVIEW_ID and CUSTOMER_ID to see if a specific customer have a tedency of providing positive or negative reviews.
